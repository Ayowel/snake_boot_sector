# Snake game on MBR

Hi ! This is an old one weekend project that I made back in 2013. I find it funny and worse sharing.

# What is it

A custom MBR (Master Boot Record) booting a snake game. If left on an usb key it will boot instead of your system.

# ScreenToGif

!\[Alt Text\](/snake.gif)

## Start from qemu
```sh
$ qemu-system-i386 snake.img
```

## Start from Virtualbox

Import snake.ova from virtualbox and start !!

## Start on your hardware using an USB key
```
sudo dd bs=512 if=snake.img of=/dev/YOUR_USB_KEY_DEVICE
```
Replace YOUR_USB_KEY_DEVICE  with sdb / sdc or .. be careful if you choose the wrong device your computer might broke.
Booting on this USB device will not hurt your computer, I promise.

## Start from bochs
```sh
$ bochs 'boot:a' 'floppya: 1_44=snake.img, status=inserted'
```
